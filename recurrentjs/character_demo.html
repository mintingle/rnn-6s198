That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us
And a million miles Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that
That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh
Oh, oh Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care? It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if, it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again? She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,

I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect

Trust me I've learned it So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts Come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile
Until the end starts If you're not the one for me
Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh when you found that the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam.
I ain't lost, just wandering" Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls to me
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables
Turning tables, yeah, turning This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall Just the guitar This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me, umm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me
That was what you told me I'm giving you up

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I, I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
In your heart I bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
Harder baby (harder baby), harder baby I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be
Your remedy, oh Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love Maybe I should leave, to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do, is for you But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all, with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just want to make love to you
Love to you, ooh baby
Love to you, yeah All I want to do is wash your clothes
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing you can't do
But keep me making love to me

And I can hear by the way you talk that talk

Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head Lay down with me
And tell me no lies
Just hold me closly
Don't patronize Don't patronize me 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't, yeah I'll close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight And I will give up this fight 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't

'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't, ooh don't
You, when you don't, yeah, yeah Hold me closer, one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me, for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face, under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart, more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better for you This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall
at sky fall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me with out the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand.... Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall (Verse 1)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Chorus 1
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all... (You're gonna wish you never met me)
Rolling in the deep... (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared (Chorus 2)
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all
Rolling in the deep... you had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all... Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating (Verse 3)
Throw your stone through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3)
We could've had it all... We could've had it all...
It all, It all, It all... We could've had it all...
Rollin' in the deep...
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all
Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I'll be better without you,
They don't know you like I do,
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
I can't bear this time,
It drags, as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind.
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity is become undone But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,
If this is ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
But nothing will never taint us I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait
I'll be home soon, I won't be late He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion [Verse 1]
When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall [x2:]
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall) Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]
Why do you love me
Do you love me...?
Why do you love me
Do you love me?
Why do you love me
Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do,
But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn [Adele]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
Every part of me
All my words to hold
And hold against me
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
'til the morning!
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess But as the years keep going by,
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me,
I should let you find me,
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me,
through the ups and downs,
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
`cause you and me, we`re good
And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
`cause I do but I really don`t want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,
I don`t really wanna see you
and I don`t want you to see me,
you would think that I was crazy,
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could
(I`m not drunk enough)
`cause you and me, we`re good
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
(`cause you and me we`re good)
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I must my way
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
You're leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have?
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Go ahead... Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here Find yourself a girl
And settle down
Live a simple life
In a quiet town Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) So steady as she goes Your friends have shown
A kink
In the single life
You've had
Too much to think
Now you need a wife Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) Well here we go again
You've found yourself
A friend
That knows you well
But no matter
What you do
You'll always feel
As though you
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes When you have completed
What you thought
You had to do
And your blood's
Depleted
To the point
Of stable glue Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) Well here we go again
You've found yourself
A friend
That knows you well
But no matter
What you do
You'll always feel
As though you
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes Settle for a girl

The Cat in the Hat
By Dr. Seuss
The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
So we sat in the house
All that cold cold wet day.
I sat there with Sally.
We sat there we two.
And I said How I wish
We had something to do!
Too wet to go out
And too cold to play ball.
So we sat in the house.
We did nothing at all.
So all we could do was to
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
And we did not like it.
Not one little bit.
BUMP!
And then
something went BUMP!
How that bump made us jump!
We looked!
Then we saw him step in on the mat!
We looked!
And we saw him!
The Cat in the Hat!
And he said to us
Why do you sit there like that?
I know it is wet
And the sun is not sunny.
But we can have
Lots of good fun that is funny!
I know some good games we could play
Said the cat.
I know some new tricks
Said the Cat in the Hat.
A lot of good tricks.
I will show them to you.
Your mother
Will not mind at all if I do.
Then Sally and I
Did not know what to say.
Our mother was out of the house
For the day.
But our fish said No! No!
Make that cat go away!
Tell that Cat in the Hat
You do NOT want to play.
He should not be here.
He should not be about.
He should not be here
When your mother is out!
Now! Now! Have no fear.
Have no fear! said the cat.
My tricks are not bad
Said the Cat in the Hat.
Why we can have
Lots of good fun if you wish
with a game that I call
UP UP UP with a fish!
Put me down! said the fish.
This is no fun at all!
Put me down! said the fish.
I do NOT wish to fall!
Have no fear! said the cat.
I will not let you fall.
I will hold you up high
As I stand on a ball.
With a book on one hand!
And a cup on my hat!
But that is not ALL I can do!
Said the cat
Look at me!
Look at me now! said the cat.
With a cup and a cake
On the top of my hat!
I can hold up TWO books!
I can hold up the fish!
And a litte toy ship!
And some milk on a dish!
And look!
I can hop up and down on the ball!
But that is not all!
Oh no.
That is not all
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me NOW!
It is fun to have fun
But you have to know how.
I can hold up the cup
And the milk and the cake!
I can hold up these books!
And the fish on a rake!
I can hold the toy ship
And a little toy man!
And look! With my tail
I can hold a red fan!
I can fan with the fan
As I hop on the ball!
But that is not all.
Oh no.
That is not all.
That is what the cat said
Then he fell on his head!
He came down with a bump
From up there on the ball.
And Sally and I
We saw ALL the things fall!
And our fish came down too.
He fell into a pot!
He said Do I like this?
Oh no! I do not.
This is not a good game
Said our fish as he lit.
No I do not like it
Not one little bit!
Now look what you did!
Said the fish to the cat.
Now look at this house!
Look at this! Look at that!
You sank our toy ship
Sank it deep in the cake.
You shook up our house
And you bent our new rake.
You SHOULD NOT be here
When our mother is not.
You get out of this house!
Said the fish in the pot.
But I like to be here.
Oh I like it a lot!
Said the Cat in the Hat
To the fish in the pot.
I will NOT go away.
I do NOT wish to go!
And so said the Cat in the Hat
So
so
so
I will show you
Another good game that I know!
And then he ran out.
And then fast as a fox
The Cat in the Hat
Came back in with a box.
A big red wood box.
It was shut with a hook.
Now look at this trick
Said the cat.
Take a look!
Then he got up on top
With a tip of his hat.
I call this game FUN IN A BOX
Said the cat.
In this box are two things
I will show to you now.
You will like these two things
Said the cat with a bow.
I will pick up the hook.
You will see something new.
Two things. And I call them
Thing One and Thing Two.
These Things will not bite you.
They want to have fun.
Then out of the box
Came Thing Two and Thing One!
And they ran to us fast.
They said How do you do?
Would you like to shake hands
With Thing One and Thing Two?
And Sally and I
Did not know what to do.
So we had to shake hands
With Thing One and Thing Two.
We shook their two hands.
But our fish said No! No!
Those Things should not be
In this house! Make them go!
They should not be here
When your mother is not!
Put them out! Put them out!
Said the fish in the pot.
Have no fear little fish
Said the Cat in the Hat.
These Things are good Things.
And he gave them a pat.
They are tame. Oh so tame!
They have come here to play.
They will give you some fun
On this wet wet wet day.
Now here is a game that they like
Said the cat.
They like to fly kites
Said the Cat in the Hat
No! Not in the house!
Said the fish in the pot.
They should not fly kites
In a house! They should not.
Oh the things they will bump!
Oh the things they will hit!
Oh I do not like it!
Not one little bit! Then Sally and I
Saw them run down the hall.
We saw those two Things
Bump their kites on the wall!
Bump! Thump! Thump! Bump!
Down the wall in the hall.
Thing Two and Thing One!
They ran up! They ran down!
On the string of one kite
We saw Mothers new gown!
Her gown with the dots
That are pink white and red.
Then we saw one kite bump
On the head of her bed!
Then those Things ran about
With big bumps jumps and kicks
And with hops and big thumps
And all kinds of bad tricks.
And I said
I do NOT like the way that they play
If Mother could see this
Oh what would she say!
Then our fish said Look! Look!
And our fish shook with fear.
Your mother is on her way home!
Do you hear?
Oh what will she do to us?
What will she say?
Oh she will not like it
To find us this way!
So DO something! Fast! said the fish.
Do you hear!
I saw her. Your mother!
Your mother is near!
So as fast as you can
Think of something to do!
You will have to get rid of
Thing One and Thing Two!
So as fast as I could
I went after my net.
And I said With my net
I can get them I bet.
I bet with my net
I can get those Things yet!
Then I let down my net.
It came down with a PLOP!
And I had them! At last!
Thoe two Things had to stop.
Then I said to the cat
Now you do as I say.
You pack up those Things
And you take them away!
Oh dear! said the cat
You did not like our game
Oh dear.
What a shame!
What a shame!
What a shame!
Then he shut up the Things
In the box with the hook.
And the cat went away
With a sad kind of look.
That is good said the fish.
He has gone away. Yes.
But your mother will come.
She will find this big mess!
And this mess is so big
And so deep and so tall
We ca not pick it up.
There is no way at all!
And THEN!
Who was back in the house?
Why the cat!
Have no fear of this mess
Said the Cat in the Hat.
I always pick up all my playthings
And so
I will show you another
Good trick that I know!
Then we saw him pick up
All the things that were down.
He picked up the cake
And the rake and the gown
And the milk and the strings
And the books and the dish
And the fan and the cup
And the ship and the fish.
And he put them away.
Then he said That is that.
And then he was gone
With a tip of his hat.
Then our mother came in
And she said to us two
Did you have any fun?
Tell me. What did you do?
And Sally and I did not know
What to say.
Should we tell her
The things that went on there that day?
Should we tell her about it?
Now what SHOULD we do?
Well
What would YOU do
If your mother asked YOU?

How The Grinch Stole Christmas
by Dr. Suess
Every Who Down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot
But the GrinchWho lived just north of Whoville Did NOT!
The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
Now please dont ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
It could be his head wasnt screwed on just right.
It could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight.
But I think that the most likely reason of all
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
Whatever the reason His heart or his shoes
He stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos
Staring down from his cave with a sour Grinchy frown
At the warm lighted windows below in their town.
For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath
Was busy now hanging a mistletoe wreath.
And theyre hanging their stockings! he snarled with a sneer
Tomorrow is Christmas! Its practically here!
Then he growled with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming
I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!
For Tomorrow he knew all the Who girls and boys
Would wake bright and early. Theyd rush for their toys!
And then! Oh the noise! Oh the Noise!
Noise! Noise! Noise!
Thats one thing he hated! The NOISE!
NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!
Then the Whos young and old would sit down to a feast.
And theyd feast! And theyd feast! And theyd FEAST!
FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!
They would feast on Who pudding and rare Who roast beast.
Which was something the Grinch couldnt stand in the least!
And THEN Theyd do something He liked least of all!
Every Who down in Whoville the tall and the small
Would stand close together with Christmas bells ringing.
Theyd stand hand in hand. And the Whos would start singing!
Theyd sing! And theyd sing! And theyd SING!
SING! SING! SING!
And the more the Grinch thought of this Who ChristmasSing
The more the Grinch thought I must stop this whole thing!
Why for fifty three years Ive put up with it now!
I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?
Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL AWFUL IDEA!
I know just what to do! The Grinch laughed in his throat.
And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
And he chuckled and clucked What a great Grinchy trick!
With this coat and this hat I look just like Saint Nick!
All I need is a reindeer The Grinch looked around.
But since reindeer are scarce there was none to be found.
Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said
If I cant find a reindeer Ill make one instead!
So he called his dog Max. Then he took some red thread
And he tied a big horn on the top of his head.
THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks
On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max.
Then the Grinch said Giddap! And the sleigh started down
Toward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town.
All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.
All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care.
When he came to the first little house on the square.
This is stop number one the old Grinchy Claus hissed
And he climbed to the roof empty bags in his fist.
Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.
But if Santa could do it then so could the Grinch.
He got stuck only once for a moment or two.
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.
Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.
These stockings he grinned are the first things to go!
Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant
Around the whole room and he took every present!
Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums!
Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!
And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch very nimbly
Stuffed all the bags one by one up the chimney!
Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos feast!
He took the Who pudding! He took the roast beast!
He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.
Why that Grinch even took their last can of Who hash!
Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.
And NOW! grinned the Grinch I will stuff up the tree!
And the Grinch grabbed the tree and he started to shove
When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
He turned around fast and he saw a small Who!
Little Cindy Lou Who who was not more than two.
The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter
Whod got out of bed for a cup of cold water.
She stared at the Grinch and said Santy Claus why????????????
Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?
But you know that old Grinch was so smart and so slick
He thought up a lie and he thought it up quick!
Why my sweet little tot the fake Santy Claus lied
Theres a light on this tree that wont light on one side.
So Im taking it home to my workshop my dear.
Ill fix it up there. Then Ill bring it back here.
And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head
And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.
And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup
HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up!
Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire!
Then he went up the chimney himself the old liar.
On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.
And the one speck of food That he left in the house
Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
Then He did the same thing To the other Whos houses
Leaving crumbs Much too small For the other Whos mouses!
It was quarter past dawn All the Whos still a bed
All the Whos still asnooze When he packed up his sled
Packed it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings!
The tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!
Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit
He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!
PoohPooh to the Whos! he was grinchishly humming.
Theyre finding out now that no Christmas is coming!
Theyre just waking up! I know just what theyll do!
Their mouths will hang open a minute or two
Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry BooHoo!
Thats a noise grinned the Grinch That I simply MUST hear!
So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.
And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
It started in low. Then it started to grow.
But the sound wasnt sad! Why this sound sounded merry!
It couldnt be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!
He stared down at Whoville! The Grinch popped his eyes!
Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!
Every Who down in Whoville the tall and the small
Was singing! Without any presents at all!
He HADNT stopped Christmas from coming! IT CAME!
Somehow or other it came just the same!
And the Grinch with his grinch feet ice cold in the snow
Stood puzzling and puzzling: How could it be so?
It came with out ribbons! It came without tags!
It came without packages boxes or bags!
And he puzzled three hours till his puzzler was sore.
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadnt before!
Maybe Christmas he thought doesnt come from a store.
Maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more!
And what happened then? Wellin Whoville they say
That the Grinchs small heart Grew three sizes that day!
And the minute his heart didnt feel quite so tight
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light
And he brought back the toys! And the food for the feast!
And he HE HIMSELF! The Grinch carved the roast beast!
